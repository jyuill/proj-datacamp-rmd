## Exploring the mtcars data set

Have you ever wondered whether there is a clear correlation between the gas consumption of a car and its weight? 
To answer this question, we first have to load the `dplyr` and `ggvis` packages. 

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(ggvis)
```

```{r chained, eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE, results='hide'}
mtcars %>%
  group_by(factor(cyl)) %>%
  ggvis(~mpg,~wt,fill=~cyl) %>%
  layer_points()
```

The *'ggvis'* plot gives us a nice visualization of the `mtcars` dataset.

```{r ref.label='chained', echo=FALSE}

```
